# FlowCompiler
 A compiler for the upcoming Flow Language.


# Language

 the flow language is a CPP compiled language. this means it uses lexical indexing to create C++ code and run that code. it is a fast and optimisable language.

 # COMPILER USAGE

 using the default command "flow ./myFile.flo -o ./output.exe -d -r -s" will compile your given file (./myFile.flo) to 
 "./output.exe". 
 _*-d*_ = debugs the operation.
 _*-r*_ = run after compilation finishes.
 _*-s*_ = saves the compiled CPP file to the directory: "C:\Flow\tasks\[current time stamp].cpp". your includes will be there as well.
